This repo walks you through fine-tuning a gpt-35-turbo-0125 model.

In this repo I will explain how to:

Create sample fine-tuning datasets.
Create environment variables for  resource endpoint and API key.
Prepare  sample training and validation datasets for fine-tuning.
Upload  training file and validation file for fine-tuning.
Create a fine-tuning job for gpt-35-turbo-0125.
Deploy a custom fine-tuned model.
